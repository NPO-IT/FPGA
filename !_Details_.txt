!! FOUND AN ISSUE FOR ADM4853 RECEIVERS !! a multiplexor on RX-Line needed. ((RX on 0, VCC on 1, DIR on Sel)).


Timing Analyser Checked:
 Verilog modules:
  - clk80Mto640K	- is actually a divider by 125
  - div21		- is a divider by 21
  - divReg		- is a divider by 2, 4, 8 and 16
  - divTen		- is a divider by 10
  - globalReset		- is a module that makes a global enable signal on scheme start (0 is reset, 1 is work)
  - UARTRXn		- is a 5Mbps 8 bit UART receiver, 80MHz clk, high level valid signal when idle
  - UART_TX_8bytes	- is a 5Mbps 8 bit UART transmitter, no parity, 80MHz clk, multiplexed 8 bytes data in
  - UART_TX_14bytes	- is a 5Mbps 8 bit UART transmitter, no parity, 80MHz clk, multiplexed 14 bytes data in
  - UART_TX_15bytes	- is a 5Mbps 8 bit UART transmitter, no parity, 80MHz clk, multiplexed 15 bytes data in, TX_Done signal

 VHDL modules:
  - UART_RX		- is a 5Mbps 8 bit UART receiver, 80MHz clk, low level valid signal when idle
 
 SystemVerilog modules:
  - memDblArray		- is a simple double array (32 arrays of 14 bytes of 8 bits)
